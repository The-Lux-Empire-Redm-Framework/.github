### **2. Collaborative Coding**

#### **Create a Pull Request**

- **Branching Strategy:**
  - Encourage the use of feature branches (e.g., `feature/new-login`).
  - Protect the `main` or `master` branch.

- **Making a Pull Request:**
  - Push your feature branch to the repository.
  - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
  - Click **"Compare & pull request"**.
  - Provide a clear title and description.
  - Assign reviewers and labels.

#### **Create a Branch Protection Rule**

- **Enforce Branch Protection:**
  - Go to **"Settings"** > **"Branches"**.
  - Click **"Add rule"** under **"Branch protection rules"**.
  - Specify the branch name pattern (e.g., `main`).

- **Configure Protection Settings:**
  - Require pull request reviews before merging.
  - Require status checks to pass before merging.
  - Restrict who can push to the branch.
  - Enable required reviews from code owners.

---

### **3. Automation and CI/CD**

#### **Auto-Assign New Issues**

- **Set Up GitHub Actions:**
  - Create a `.github/workflows/auto-assign.yml` file in your repository.

- **Example Workflow:**

  ```yaml
  name: Auto Assign
  on:
    issues:
      types: [opened]
  jobs:
    assign:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/assign@v2
          with:
            assignees: 'username1, username2'
  ```

- **Configuration:**
  - Replace `'username1, username2'` with the usernames of team members.
  - This action will automatically assign new issues to specified users.

#### **Run a Continuous Integration Test**

- **Set Up CI with GitHub Actions:**
  - Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

- **Example Workflow:**

  ```yaml
  name: CI
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
    pull_request:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Set up Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: '14'
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: npm install
        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test
  ```

- **Adjust According to Your Stack:**
  - Modify the steps to fit your project's programming language and testing tools.

### **4. Create Rules and Regulations for Safety**

#### **Security Policies**

- **Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
  - Go to **"Settings"** > **"Authentication security"**.
  - Require 2FA for all members.

- **Manage Access Control:**
  - Limit **Owner** roles to key personnel.
  - Regularly review team permissions.

- **Set Up Code Owners:**
  - Use a `CODEOWNERS` file to specify who should review changes to specific parts of your codebase.

#### **Code Quality and Review**

- **Establish Coding Standards:**
  - Define a style guide for your programming languages.
  - Use linters and formatters to enforce style.

- **Implement Mandatory Code Reviews:**
  - Require at least one approval before merging a pull request.
  - Use branch protection rules to enforce this.

- **Use Pull Request Templates:**
  - Create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file in the `.github` folder.
  - Include sections for description, testing, and impact.

#### **Issue Management**

- **Create Issue Templates:**
  - Add issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
  - This standardizes the information needed for efficient triage.

#### **Compliance and Legal**

- **Add a Code of Conduct:**
  - Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to set expectations for behavior.

- **Contributor License Agreement (CLA):**
  - If necessary, require contributors to sign a CLA.

#### **Automated Security and Dependency Management**

- **Enable Dependabot:**
  - Go to **"Settings"** > **"Security & analysis"**.
  - Enable **Dependabot alerts** and **Dependabot security updates**.

- **Configure Secret Scanning:**
  - Enable secret scanning to detect leaked secrets in the codebase.

#### **Backup and Recovery**

- **Repository Backups:**
  - Regularly backup critical repositories.
  - Use `git clone --mirror` for full backups.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan:**
  - Establish a plan for data loss scenarios.

### **5. Additional Best Practices**

#### **Communication**

- **Regular Meetings:**
  - Hold team meetings to discuss progress and blockers.

- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain a `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions.
  - Use a wiki or additional markdown files for detailed documentation.

#### **Monitoring and Auditing**

- **Enable Audit Logging:**
  - Monitor changes in the organization.

- **Set Up Notifications:**
  - Configure notifications for important events.

#### **Training and Onboarding**

- **Onboarding Process:**
  - Create documentation to help new members get started.

- **Security Training:**
  - Educate team members on security best practices.

#### **Continuous Improvement**

- **Retrospectives:**
  - Regularly review what is working and what can be improved.

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Encourage team members to provide feedback on policies and workflows.
